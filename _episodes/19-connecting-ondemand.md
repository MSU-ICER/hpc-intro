## Secure Connections

The first step in using a cluster is to establish a connection from our laptop
to the cluster. When we are sitting at a computer (or standing, or holding it
in our hands or on our wrists), we have come to expect a visual display with
icons, widgets, and perhaps some windows or applications: a _graphical user
interface_, or GUI. Since computer clusters are remote resources that we
connect to over slow or intermittent interfaces (WiFi and VPNs especially), it
is more practical to use a _command-line interface_, or CLI, to send commands
as plain-text. If a command returns output, it is printed as plain text as
well. The commands we run today will not open a window to show graphical
results.

If you have ever opened the Windows Command Prompt or macOS Terminal, you have
seen a CLI. If you have already taken The Carpentries' courses on the UNIX
Shell or Version Control, you have used the CLI on your _local machine_
extensively. The only leap to be made here is to open a CLI on a _remote machine_,
while taking some precautions so that other folks on the network can't see (or
change) the commands you're running or the results the remote machine sends
back. We will use the Secure SHell protocol (or SSH) to open an encrypted
network connection between two machines, allowing you to send & receive text
and data without having to worry about prying eyes.

SSH clients are usually command-line tools, where you provide the remote
machine address as the only required argument. If your username on the remote
system differs from what you use locally, you must provide that as well. If
your SSH client has a graphical front-end, such as PuTTY or MobaXterm, you will
set these arguments before clicking "connect." From the terminal, you'll write
something like `ssh userName@hostname`, where the argument is just like an
email address: the "@" symbol is used to separate the personal ID from the
address of the remote machine.

### Connecting with OnDemand

Instead of using a shell application installed on your computer, you can
shortcut much of this process using a shell in your browser that directly
connects to the cluster.

To do so, login to the cluster's Open OnDemand interface at this link: <{{
site.ondemand.address }}>. If you are prompted, choose {{ site.remote.location
}} as the Identity Provider, and login using your site credentials.

Here, you will find many different interactive applications and ways access the
cluster. It is possible that these may be the only ways you work with the
cluster in the future! But for now, we will make sure that you can get started
using the command line since it is traditionally the most common and flexible
access method.

To open a command line connected to the cluster from OnDemand, choose any entry
from the {{ site.ondemand.login_tab }} tab. For the remainder of this lesson,
we will use {{ site.remote.host }}.

## Looking Around Your Remote Home

Very often, many users are tempted to think of a high-performance computing
installation as one giant, magical machine. Sometimes, people will assume that
the computer they've logged onto is the entire computing cluster. So what's
really happening? What computer have we logged on to? The name of the current
computer we are logged onto can be checked with the `hostname` command. (You
may also notice that the current hostname is also part of our prompt!)

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} hostname
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.host }}
```
{: .output}

So, we're definitely on the remote machine. Next, let's find out where we are
by running `pwd` to **p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.homedir }}/{{ site.remote.user }}
```
{: .output}

Great, we know where we are! Let's see what's in our current directory:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}
```
id_ed25519.pub
```
{: .output}

The system administrators may have configured your home directory with some
helpful files, folders, and links (shortcuts) to space reserved for you on
other filesystems. If they did not, your home directory may appear empty. To
double-check, include hidden files in your directory listing:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls -a
```
{: .language-bash}
```
  .            .bashrc           id_ed25519.pub
  ..           .ssh
```
{: .output}

In the first column, `.` is a reference to the current directory and `..` a
reference to its parent (`{{ site.remote.homedir }}`). You may or may not see
the other files, or files like them: `.bashrc` is a shell configuration file,
which you can edit with your preferences; and `.ssh` is a directory storing SSH
keys and a record of authorized connections.
